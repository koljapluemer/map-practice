* see that both circle and country are set to correct/incorrect (only one of them is clicked) [when first loading the countries this already works]
* extend testing
* check if due `<progress>` works correctly
* bug: when nemesis dict is all 0, something will still be nemesis (likely similar with the others)
* consider implementing proper patterns like Observer into `main.js`, e.g. with stats (see `DOC.md`)
* find a better way to show the right country: circle was never good, and is now broken
* see that I can reintroduce the quick zoom buttons
* find out how to adapt pan-zoom stuff to the library
* make stats and links viewable on mobile
